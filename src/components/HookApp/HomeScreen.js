        <hr/>

        <p>
            This is the hook implementation of each hook at my Hook Practice repository, feel free to click each item on the nav bar and guessing how it works            
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          If you don't want to guess just look at my repository: <a href='https://github.com/jorge2805/hook-app'>https://github.com/jorge2805/hook-app</a> 
        </p>
    </div>
